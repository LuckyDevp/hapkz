## How It Works

`hapksz` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to compile Python, C++, and C# source files into standalone Windows executables (`.exe`). It supports the following commands:

- **Python:**  

*hapkz filename.py --onefilesx filename.exe*

- **C++:**  

*hapks filename.cpp --oxpp filename.exe*

- **C#:**  

*hapksz filename.cs --convertx filename.exe*


The tool locates the source file, invokes the appropriate compiler, and generates the executable in the same directory as the source file. It requires the respective compilers installed on your system.
